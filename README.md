# MNIST Dataset Training using Keras

This project demonstrates training a deep learning model on the MNIST dataset using the Keras library. The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, widely used as a benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel image, representing a digit from 0 to 9. The dataset is pre-divided into training and test sets, allowing us to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Keras (2.x or higher)
- TensorFlow (2.x or higher)
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- seaborn (for visualization)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-dataset-training.git
